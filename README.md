# Brainiac

Brainiac is a simulated brain project designed to mimic human cognitive functions, including visual and auditory processing, emotion generation, decision making, and learning. The project integrates various neural networks and sensory inputs to provide real-time responses and emotional feedback based on the environment.

## Features

- **Visual Processing:** Processes video input to detect edges and analyze brightness.
- **Auditory Processing:** Captures and processes audio input to recognize speech and analyze sentiment.
- **Tactile Processing:** Simulates tactile input processing.
- **Emotion Generation:** Generates emotional responses based on sensory inputs.
- **Decision Making:** Makes decisions based on processed sensory inputs.
- **Learning Algorithms:** Adapts to the environment using learning algorithms.
- **Motor Control:** Simulates motor control functions.
